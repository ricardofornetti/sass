        For the many who witnessed The Beatles’ early appearances on British television, 
        this song is synonymous with those exciting era–defining times. 
        The power of the band’s performances and the recording owes so much to John’s 
        searing vocal. For their debut album, John recorded his vocal in one take at the end 
        of a marathon recording session on February 11th 1963.

        In July 1963, ‘Twist And Shout’ became the title track of the band’s first EP to be 
        released in the UK. According to the advert on the front of New Musical Express, 
        it was “The record you’ve been asking for”. A week after Twist And Shout was 
        released it made the EP best-seller list and a week after that topped the same 
        chart staying there for ten weeks.

        The second Beatles’ movie theme song to top the charts, this was also the second 
        song from the sound-track of Help! to make No.1 in both the UK and America. 
        When The Beatles’ second featurelength film was announced to the press in 
        mid-March 1965, the working title was ‘Eight Arms To Hold You’. 
        Some four weeks later, with a new title settled and a theme song needed, 
        the band were in Studio Two at Abbey Road recording ‘Help!’.

        During a four-hour recording session on the evening of 13 April 1965, 
        it took eight takes to get the rhythm track down on tape. By take 12, 
        which includes George’s descending guitar motif, the vocals were deemed 
        perfect and added.
        This clip is from one of several promos for Beatles’ singles that were made at 
        Twickenham.

        ‘Can’t Buy Me Love’ entered the UK singles’ chart at No.8 and the following week it

        Work on the Rediffusion Television special in the UK, Around The Beatles took 
        place while the Beatles were also filming A Hard Day’s Night, which rather aptly 
        summed up the band’s lifestyle at this point. The show’s title dictated the 
        creative angle for the programme in that The Beatles were filmed ‘in the round’.
      </article>

    <div class="articulo1">
      The producer was 32-year–old Jack Good, an innovator of TV pop shows for teenagers. 
      Not only was Around The Beatles to be filmed in front of a live audience, but the 
      shoot would also be fairly complex, so it was decided that the band would mime to 
      tracks that had been pre-recorded at IBC Studios in London.

        The title song and the opening track of their third album is from The Beatles’ 
        first feature film. On its release – the same day as the LP A Hard Day’s Night – it 
        became their seventh UK single. It was a song written to order by John and Paul, 
        after a quip from Ringo became the working title for the movie they had begun 
        filming on 2 March 1964. The official press announcement of their forthcoming film, 
        A Hard Day’s Night came on 13 April, and three days later the band was at Abbey Road 
        to record the title song.

        A Hard Day’s Night’ featured mid-way through the band’s set in Paris and stayed 
        there throughout the tour, which took in Lyon, Milan, Genoa, Rome, Nice, Madrid 
        before finishing in Barcelona on 3 July. In the clip, George is playing 
        the 12-string Rickenbacker that he used to such good effect on the original single.
